The main goal if this challenge was to see if I could use React Accessibility Components in astro.

It turns out I was able to do so, but the component I used from Radix Primitives seems to have interactivity with it. Making it to where I need to load it on the client.

I have a feeling it's possible to do the same FAQ component in Astro but without the needed interactivity. Perhaps something using the dialog element.

All in all it was fun. I spent way too long on try to figure out the overflow on the desktop part of the box for this challenge lol.
